# Billtracker

A Ruby on Rails application for updating and approving energy bills.

During development I used Rails version 7.0.4 and PostgreSQL version 14.5.

Additional gems used in the project: pg, devise, simple_form, hotwire-rails, bootstrap-sass, jquery-rails.

Seeding the database creates two users (employee and manager) and one bill to facilitate testing of the application.
